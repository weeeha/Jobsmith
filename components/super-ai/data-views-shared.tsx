   A section declares its groups, its card, its columns and its row once; the
   <DataViews> switcher picks a shell by ViewMode. Adding a sixth view means
   adding one shell and one contract here — no section changes.

   Everything shared by the view shells lives in this file rather than in the
   entry point, so the shells can import it without importing `data-views.tsx`
   back — the entry imports every shell, and the reverse edge would be a cycle.

 * for raw Tailwind palette classes, and the neutral pair was the exact
 * muted-foreground-on-muted combination `check:tokens` exists to catch, at
 * 4.34:1 against a 4.5:1 minimum.
 *
 * (Those class names are described rather than quoted on purpose: the contract
 * lint scans comments too, so writing them literally here would fail the gate
 * this comment is explaining.)
 *
 * This system has two chromatic tokens, `--destructive` and `--warning`. There
 * is no `--success` and no `--info`. So the idiom is J5 `record-list`'s, which
 * states the rule outright: the colour goes on the icon only, because
 * `text-destructive` measures 4.0:1 — fine for a graphic, not fine for a label.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate and worth stating plainly: `info` and `success`
 * both resolve to `text-primary` and are told apart by **shape**, not hue. A
 * board that read as coloured bands now reads as neutral bands with marks.
 * Colour alone stops separating four tones — which is also why every consumer
 * of this map pairs the mark with `GROUP_TONE_LABEL` in the accessible name.
