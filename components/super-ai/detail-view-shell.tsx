   Overlay geometry.

   Upstream every utility here carried a `data-[side=right]:` prefix, and that
   prefix was load-bearing *there*: it existed to out-specify shadcn's own
   `data-[side=right]:inset-y-0 / right-0 / h-full / sm:max-w-sm`, which compile
   to `.class[data-side=right]` and beat a bare `.class` outright — silently,
   because tailwind-merge only dedupes classes whose modifier sets match, so an
   overridden utility stays in the class list looking like it applied.

   That war is over. Overlay mode is now a plain `<aside>` with no competing
   Sheet styles and no `data-side` attribute at all, so the prefixes would match
   nothing and the panel would render unpositioned. They are dropped, and this
   note stays as the record of why they were ever there — anyone reinstating a
   Sheet here has to reinstate them too.

/* Overlay mode only earns its keep while the board behind stays usable — that

   viewport can actually spare, not just by a share of it.

   `100vw - 540px` reserves the 232px sidebar, the 8px float, and ~300px of
   live board column. `min()` lets the percentage lead on a large display and
   the reservation take over on a laptop, so one rule covers both:

     1280px  min(832, 740) =  740  → 300px of board still visible
     1512px  min(983, 972) =  972  → 300px
     1680px  min(1092,1140)= 1092  → 348px (unchanged from what shipped)
     1920px  min(1248,1380)= 1248  → 432px

   The old `min-w-[1100px]` did the opposite: on a 1280px laptop it claimed
   more than the viewport had to give, leaving ~180px of board — fullscreen
   with extra steps. Minimums here are floors the viewport can still afford.

   Below ~1180px the three-column overlay genuinely does not fit; the floor
   stops it collapsing into nonsense, but popup or fullscreen is the honest
   mode at that size. */

       is worth stating.

       Upstream this was a Radix Sheet with three overrides whose combined
       effect was to switch off everything that makes a Sheet a dialog:
       `modal={false}` released the scroll-lock and the dim, a transparent
       `overlayClassName` let clicks reach the collection, and two prevented
       outside-close handlers stopped a click away from closing it. All three
       served one goal — the collection behind stays live, so clicking a second
       record SWAPS this panel's content instead of closing it.

       None of those three props exist on this repo's Sheet, which is Base UI
       rather than Radix and renders its own backdrop with no className
       passthrough. Rebuilding "a dialog with its dialog-ness disabled" on top
       of whichever primitive a consumer happens to have installed is exactly
       the kind of thing that breaks silently on the next shadcn bump.

       So overlay mode is what it always behaviourally was: an aside docked to
       the right, with no focus trap (correct — the collection is still
       operable), no scroll lock, no backdrop, and Escape to close. Popup mode
       is still a real Dialog, because popup genuinely is modal. */
