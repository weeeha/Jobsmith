    /* A `<section>` with a tab stop, not a bare `<div>`: the board scrolls
       sideways as soon as the columns outrun the viewport, and a scroll
       container that cannot take focus is unreachable by keyboard — axe
       `scrollable-region-focusable`, whose real consequence is that a keyboard
       user sees the first two columns of a board and cannot reach the rest.
       The element is a `<section>` because a bare `<div>` is `role="generic"`,
       where ARIA prohibits `aria-label`, so the tab stop would arrive
       anonymous; `shortcuts-sheet` is the precedent, corrected in review for
       exactly that reason, and the name is the region's contents rather than
       the view's title. Found by DataViews' `Mobile` story — the defect is
       invisible at desktop width, because nothing overflows there. */
