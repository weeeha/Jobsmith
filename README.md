# Jobsmith

Jobsmith is one app for a whole job search: find, qualify, apply, research,
prepare for each interview stage, debrief. It is open source under
AGPL-3.0 and self-hostable with your own database and, later, your own AI
provider key.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm
- Docker, for the local Postgres in `docker-compose.yml`

## First run

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

- `DATABASE_URL`: leave the default if you use `docker-compose.yml`.
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- `APP_URL`: required for local development and self-hosting. Use
  `http://localhost:3000` here. On Vercel it can be left unset for
  Preview, and for Production unless a custom domain is used, because the
  app derives it from Vercel's system environment variables.

The database scripts (`db:migrate`, `seed`, `reset-db`) read `DATABASE_URL`
from the shell environment, not from `.env` directly. Export it before
running them, then continue:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
docker compose up -d
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The first visit redirects to `/setup`, which
creates the only account this instance will accept until you set
`ALLOW_SIGNUP=true`.

## Running behind a reverse proxy

The login rate limit keys on the client address, read from the
`X-Forwarded-For` header. Behind a reverse proxy, set that header to the
real client address, or every visitor is rate-limited as one shared
client.

`AUTH_SIGNIN_MAX_PER_MINUTE` is optional and defaults to 5.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Run the app locally |
| `pnpm build` | Production build |
| `pnpm start` | Run a production build |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Generate route types, then check them |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint, then the token lint (`check:tokens`) |
| `pnpm check:tokens` | Fails on raw colors, palette classes or arbitrary values outside `components/ui` |
| `pnpm test` | Unit and integration tests (Vitest) |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | End-to-end tests (Playwright), resets the database first |
| `pnpm db:generate` | Generate a SQL migration from the schema |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Apply migrations |
| `pnpm seed` | Create a fictional demo user and profile |
| `pnpm reset-db` | Drop and re-migrate a local database (refuses non-local hosts) |

## Tests

`pnpm test` runs the unit and integration suite (Vitest).

`pnpm test:e2e` runs the end-to-end suite (Playwright), using the same
environment as First run. It needs the local Postgres running, resets it,
and starts its own server on port 3000, or on `PORT` when set, with a
matching `APP_URL`.

## Design system

Tokens, vendored primitives and the re-sync process are documented in
`docs/design-system.md`. `pnpm check:tokens` enforces the token rules
outside `components/ui`.
